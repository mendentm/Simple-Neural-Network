# Simple-Neural-Network
A simple NN trained on the MNIST dataset. 

11/21/24 Made updates to plotting and accuracy and loss. Made them archive into folders for history retention. Accuracy and loss is in a running txt file and the plots are saved per each round of epochs. 

NEXT AGENDA: 
Run training under optional GPU if detected. 
Create an ignore file to ignore the pycache being pushed to git. 
Create another model to fulfill assignment.
